# Notebook 2018-19

This is where we will put notebook files for this year. We can also keep them in Google Drive.

* Source is for Latex files
* Output is for compiled Latex/PDF files
* Resources is for pictures or scanned sketches, but these can also be kept in Google Drive or in the notebook files themselves.

This format can be changed if the team feels it would be better organized another way. (That's what Git is for!)
